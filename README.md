## Why it is Interesting
As a student who born in the era of centralized Web, it is hard to realize that there is anything wrong with centralized Web. Reading Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the Web, made me think about how centralized Web would "destroy" the world and how we can do to prevent it from happening.

Berners-lee clearly has the forsight to plan for the potential worsening of the "world wide web" issues. I also think it is really cool that he is colabarating with regular software developers to work on his latest project.
