## Why it is Interesting
As a student who born in the era of centralized Web, it is hard to realize that there is anything wrong with centralized Web. Reading Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the Web, made me think about how centralized Web would "destroy" the world and how we can do to prevent it from happening.

Berners-lee clearly has the forsight to plan for the potential worsening of the "world wide web" issues. I also think it is really cool that he is colabarating with regular software developers to work on his latest project.

To read about what the inventor of the internet thinks about the current state of the technolgy and its impact on the world is fascinating--especially when Tim Berners-Lee isn't particularly proud about his accomplishment, but worried about its future and the misusage of its power. This notion of decentralized web is definitely something that's increasingly brought up, and I'm excited to see which direction the technology will turn towards.
